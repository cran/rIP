Description: Takes an array of IPs and the keys for the services the user wishes to use (IP Hub, IP Intel, and Proxycheck), 
    and passes these to all respective APIs. Returns a dataframe with the IP addresses (used for merging), 
    country, ISP, labels for non-US IP Addresses, VPS use, and recommendations for blocking. The package 
    also provides optional visualization tools for checking the distributions. Additional
    functions are provided to call each discrete API endpoint. The package and methods are detailed in the recent paper 
    Waggoner, Kennedy, and Clifford (2019) <doi:10.21105/joss.01285>.
